Travel App is basically a program written in C++ that has two interfaces; Admin and Customer. It helps both of them track rides each day.

## Description
The project is based on a dataset of 1.56 GB consisting of around 14 million rows having 13 attributes. The project is basically a Travel App that deals with two interfaces, Admin and Customers involving various concepts of Data Structures, and OOP.CSV filing format is used in the project. The program is designed by using different searching, sorting techniques, classification, and clustering using the K-means clustering algorithm. Initially, the data is stored in the Doubly Link list, Stacks, and AVL Tree. The algorithm of NaiveBayes is used to predict Covid for users who are about to travel. The Statistics of Travel app will be displayed at the end of the program as an application of clustering.
